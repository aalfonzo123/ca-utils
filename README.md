# ca-utils

## Introduction

This is a CLI utility to:
* List, create, etc. Conversational Analytics agents.
* Export BigQuery metadata in the format that Conversational Analytics expects

It is mainly a wrapper around REST methods for those functionalities, using these libraries:
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to execute http methods
- [Cyclopts](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts) to easily convert Python functions into CLI commands
- [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), to list items in table format, instead of a raw JSON dump
