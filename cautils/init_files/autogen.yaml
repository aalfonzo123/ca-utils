# This file serves as input to the `ca-utils data-agent autogen` command.
# In this file you specify the BigQuery tables from which metadata will be extracted.

# --- begin sample ---
# bqDataSources:
#   - as-alf-argolis.fcc_political_ads.*
#   - as-alf-argolis.fda_food.food_enforcement
# --- end sample ---
#
# There are two formats:
# - project.dataset.table. For a single table
# - project.dataset.*. For all the tables in a dataset
#
#
# Note: make sure that all fields and all tables have a description.
# It makes a __very important__ difference in the agent’s ability to create proper SQL
# and therefore a __very important__ difference in response quality. To automatically
# create those descriptions, you can use Gemini BQ data insights.
