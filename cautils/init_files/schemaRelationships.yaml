# This file has a list of relationships between tables. It is used by the data agent to do joins
# between them on SQL statements.
#
# A draft of this file should be created with `ca-utils data-agent autogen`, and then manually
# modified, as it can have mistakes or omissions. For this file, autogen infers contents
# using an LLM, it is not a deterministic process.
